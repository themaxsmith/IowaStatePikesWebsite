## About
This website is built to be a easy website to edit and modify the website in a easy and quick way. The website is directly hosted by github pages (its free, yay). It will automatically be built and deployed with new edits and PR's.

## How to change the website
### If you don't know how to code 
That is ok, you can make most text changes with ease. Just open the index.html file and find/edit the text you need to. After editing, you should have a pull request that someone can approve. If you get stuck you can always ask for help. Find any computer science / software major and they will know what this all means.
### If you know what you are doing
Great, just make any changes you want and make a pull request. I will also be happy to give you full modification rights to you as well.
